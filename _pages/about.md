## Research Statement

He is an interdisciplinary researcher centered on **causal inference**, with research interests spanning **experimental design**, **online learning**, **social networks**, and **partial identification**. His work focuses on understanding and constructing the fundamental components of causal learning systems, aiming to address the following key questions:

1. **In observational studies**, how can we systematically characterize the fundamental relationship among *model assumptions*, *observed data*, and *identification boundaries*?

2. **In offline experimental design**, how can we elucidate the interaction between *model assumptions*, *estimator structure*, and *estimation efficiency*?

3. **In online learning and decision-making**, how can we build a unified mathematical framework to connect heterogeneous goals and techniques across *machine learning*, *economics and management*, and *mathematical statistics*—for example, seeking optimal trade-offs between regret and estimation?

His long-term goal is to promote a **unified integration of causal inference and machine learning systems**, approached from two complementary directions:

- On the one hand, to advance causal system design from a machine learning perspective, including:  
  *(i) relaxed input assumptions; (ii) more efficient estimation structures; (iii) output forms with broader generalization*;

- On the other hand, to explore how causal thinking can contribute back to foundational disciplines such as:  
  social network analysis, game-theoretic modeling, and optimization algorithm design,  
  further supporting decision-making in practical applications like **recommendation systems, dispatching mechanisms, and market intervention strategies**.

His [representative research works](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=YVXrszoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) aim to establish a closed-loop paradigm of *“identification–estimation–policy optimization”*, seeking a unified modeling pathway for *“assumptions–structures–inference objectives”*, and promoting the integration of causal learning theory and real-world applications.

Open to discussions and collaborations at any time. You can add his [WeChat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZHzhang01/ZHzhang01.github.io/master/images/wechat_617.png). 


他是一名以因果推断为核心的交叉学科研究者，研究兴趣涵盖 **实验设计**、**在线学习**、**社交网络** 以及 **部分识别** 等议题。他的研究聚焦于理解和建构因果学习系统中的基本组成要素，并试图回答以下关键问题：

1. **在观测性研究中**，如何系统地刻画 “模型假设 — 观测数据 — 识别边界” 之间的基本关系？
2. **在离线实验设计中**，如何阐明 “模型假设 — 估计器结构 — 估计效率” 之间的相互作用？
3. **在在线学习与决策中**，如何构建统一的数学框架，连接 “机器学习 — 经济管理 — 数理统计” 中异构的目标与技术，例如在 regret–estimation 之间寻求最优权衡？

他的长期目标是推动 **因果推理与机器学习系统的融合统一**，从两个互补方向展开：

- 一方面，从机器学习角度推动因果系统的设计，包括：  
  *(i) 更宽松的输入假设；(ii) 更高效的估计结构；(iii) 更具泛化性的输出形式*；
- 另一方面，探索如何将因果视角反哺其他基础领域的理论与方法，例如：  
  社交网络分析、博弈论建模、优化算法设计 等，  
  并进一步支撑 **推荐系统、派单机制、市场干预策略** 等现实应用场景中的决策优化。

他的[代表性研究成果](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=YVXrszoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)尝试构建了*“识别-估计-策略优化”*的闭环范式，寻求*“假设-结构-推断目标”*的统一建模路径，致力于推动因果学习理论与应用的结合。

他欢迎相关的交流或合作。若感兴趣，可添加他的[WeChat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZHzhang01/ZHzhang01.github.io/master/images/wechat_617.png)。

<!--
A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).



Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.


How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
